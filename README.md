# FootballStatsAnalysis

The Power BI project presents a comprehensive analysis of playeres form the top 5 European leagues, taking into account their positions on the pitch.
The dashboards allow for the comparison of individual player statistics in the context of both leagues and position.
It uses interactive visualizations to indentify the best players in each position.
This tool was designed to support the scouting process by enabling quick filtering and evaluation of players based on key indicators relevant to our needs.
The project serves as a useful complement to traditional methods of player assessment.
The completed project stems from my strong interest in football.
